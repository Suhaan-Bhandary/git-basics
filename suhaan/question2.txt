Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. You should have a working demo of it.

To add a remote repository we can use the command `git remote add remote-name remote-url`

Adding multiple remote repository:
git remote add repo1 repo1-url
git remote add repo2 repo2-url
git remote add repo3 repo3-url

`git remote` command can be then used to view all the remote repositories.

Use Cases:
1. In open source projects, once a repository is forked we can add a remote of the original to our forked one for pulling the upstream changes.

2.We can use it to store backup and If one of the service provider is offline or crashes for sometime then we can use other provider.

3. Companies can keep two repository for same project one for internal use and other for public.

Working Demo:

1. Adding gitlab `git remote add gitlab git@gitlab.com:suhaanbhandary1/git-basics.git`

2. Viewing all remote `git remote -v`
Output:
gitlab	git@gitlab.com:suhaanbhandary1/git-basics.git (fetch)
gitlab	git@gitlab.com:suhaanbhandary1/git-basics.git (push)
origin	git@github.com:Suhaan-Bhandary/git-basics.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:Suhaan-Bhandary/git-basics.git (push)

3. git push gitlab suhaan

Note: The push will only push the suhaan branch on gitlab and no other branch.
