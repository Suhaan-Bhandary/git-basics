Q4. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it.

For deleting one or more commit we can use git reset.

Deleting last commit: `git reset --hard HEAD~`
Deleting last n commits: `git reset --hard HEAD~n` 

Here,
--hard reverts the commit and also permanently delete the changes.
