Q6. How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.

Once the changes are in the staged area we can use the command `git restore --staged <file or pattern>` to un-stage the changes.

Example:
`git restore --staged .` will un-stage all the changes from the current directory and below.
`git restore --staged trial.txt` will only un-stage the trial.txt file.
