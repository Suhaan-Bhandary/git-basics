Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit.

To combine C2 and C3 we can use squash from git rebase.
Command: `git rebase -i HEAD~Count`, here -i means it opens the rebase in interactive mode and Count is the number of commits we want in the rebase interactive mode.

git rebase -i HEAD~3, we pull the last 3 commits.
So C2, C3 and C4 are pulled in interactive mode.
Now we can write s or squash in front of C3 commit and then it will be merged with the commit behind it, in our case C2.Once we exit from the interactive mode, we see a window to add a new commit message for the squashed commits.

Working Demo:
In suhaan branch created 4 commit and then merged the middle 2 using the above method.
